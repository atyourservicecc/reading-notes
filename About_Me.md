## About Me
My name is Wanda Johnson. I was born in Rockford, IL, but spent most of my life in Memphis. I moved to Cedar Rapids January 2008 (6 months before the flood) by just pulling out a map and picking a state...bazaar I know! I went to school at the University of Memphis, but transferred to Upper Iowa University Cedar Rapids location. When I graduted June 2009 I was the first graduate of that location with a Bachelor in Psychology and will be featured in the alumni magazine next month.

I love being resourceful and learning all things technology. When I'm not doing that you can find me volunteering with my daughter’s Girl Scouts troop (Daisy Troop Leader) or at her school via PTO (2021-2022 PTO President), helping friends with organizing or planning things, attending various events in the city with my daughter, Mai or watching various educational TV shows on Netflix, or thinking of something creative to do with my numerous craft items (my daughter and I love recreating things from Pinterest or repurposing things). While I am usually on the move, I am always more than willing to stop and chat—so be sure if you ever have a question....just ask! :speaking_head:

Ten years ago I launched my virtual assistant business, [At Your Service Corridor Community](https://atyourservicecorridorcommunity.com). I am a Solutions Specialist. I help entrepreneurs and small business owners take control of their to do lists by assessing their business situations, developing a plan and executing solutions. I specialize in streamlining processes and tackling the most overwhelming tasks. I started teaching continuing education classes at Kirkwood Community College 8 years ago. I do many of the Microsoft Office courses and have a few classes of my own; Time Management, iPhone series, Mac, Becoming a Virtual Assistant, just to name a few _[click here to see a sample of the courses](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EqzMeS3rYPQKBM761AMee36oJojuIHLF/view?usp=sharing)_ .
