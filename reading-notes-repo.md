## What is Markdown?
Remember the 80's movies like Short Circuit or someone trying to hack into a big computer system to either steal money or keep this worldwide overruling from happening and you will see them entering all these words with # and * signs? That is what they use to tell the computer different things to recognize in what they were writing. Telling the computer that those items are the most important items to pay attention to. They were using 'markdown'. Some of it you can see easily now if you open a word document and have it show/hide symbols on your document. Markdown even allows you to add links and the things that everyone is familiar with, emojis! _[click here to see which ones](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)_.

## What is a Text Editor?
When someone is ready to create a website they don't just go out to GoDaddy, buy a domain and start uploading things. Usually there is some items that need to be typed and edited to show bold, italics, a specific font size and even a specific color. The best way to do this is to use a Text Editor program. The features that can make the process easier and quicker is:
1. **Code Completion** - when suggested texts appear when typing something. It is similar to when you typing a text in your phone and when you start typing a word your phone has 3 words that pop up above the keyboard area. You can click on one of those words to have the remainder of the word completed for you. Just imagine if it could give you options for an entire sentence! 
2. **Shorthand Language (Emmet)** - This is similar to what a court room secretary does when they are recording everything said or done during a trial or court case.
3. **Syntax Highlighting** - This is when text appears in different colors to make it easier to know when different elements of the website it being typed so making updates and/or creations can be faster. Similar to when you text someone on your phone. Your text bubbles are either green or blue and the other person you are texting with bubble is white. When you go back to look for something and you know they sent it to you, you will look in the white bubbles.
